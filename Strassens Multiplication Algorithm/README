The program takes an input variable n > 0 in the Linux command line to generate two n*n random float matrices, A and B, and compute A * B using the Strassenâ€™s matrix multiplication algorithm for the following two cases. To generate A and B, random float numbers that range between -5.0 and 5.0 are generated.
Also standard multiplication is impleneted to compare the results.

Compilation:
gcc -o strassen.out strassen.c

Running:
./strassen.out <n>
